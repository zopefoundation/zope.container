3.7.0 (unreleased)
------------------

- ...

3.6.2 (2008-10-21)
------------------

- Fixed bug in ``_zope_app_container_contained.c``.

3.6.1 (2008-10-15)
------------------

- Reimplemented the BTreeContainer so that it directly accesses the btree
  methods (removed an old #TODO)

- Removed usage of deprecated LayerField.

- Made C code compatible with Python 2.5 on 64bit architectures.

- Fixed bug: Error thrown during __setitem__ for an ordered container
  leaves bad key in order

- Fixed https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope3/+bug/238579,
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope3/+bug/163149: Error with unicode
  traversing

- Fixed https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope3/+bug/221025: The Adding menu
  is sorted with translated item by using a collator (better localized
  sorting)

- Fixed https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope3/+bug/227617:
    - prevent the namechooser from failing on '+', '@' and '/'
    - added tests in the namechooser
    - be sure the name chooser returns unicode

- Fixed https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope3/+bug/175388: The setitem's
  size modification is now done in ``setitemf``: setting an existing
  item does not change the size, and the event subscribers should see
  the new size instead of the old size.

3.6.0 (2008-05-06)
------------------

- Added an ``IBTreeContainer`` interface that allows an argument to the
  ``items``, ``keys``, and ``values`` methods with the same semantics as for
  a BTree object.  The extended interface is implemented by the
  ``BTreeContainer`` class.

3.5 (2007-10-11)
----------------

- Updated bootstrap script to current version.

- Store length of ``BTreeContainer`` in its own ``Length`` object for faster
  ``__len__`` implementation of huge containers.

- Send ``IObjectModifiedEvent`` when changing the title through the
  ``@@contents.html`` view.
  This fixes https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/zope3/+bug/98483.

- Resolve ``ZopeSecurityPolicy`` and ``IRolePermissionManager`` deprecation
  warning.

3.4 (2007-04-22)
----------------

- Initial release as a separate project, corresponds to ``zope.app.container``
  from Zope 3.4.0a1.
