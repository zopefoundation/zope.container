movedaddedremoved-branch (unreleased)
--------------------------------------

- Rid ourselves of ``IObjectMovedEvent``, ``IObjectAddedEvent``,
  ``IObjectRemovedEvent`` interfaces and ``ObjectMovedEvent``,
  ``ObjectAddedEvent`` and ``ObjectRemovedEvent`` classes on this
  branch, moved to ``zope.lifecycleevent`` in the movedaddedremoved
  branch at
  svn+ssh://svn.zope.org/repos/main/zope.lifecycleevent/branches/movedaddedremoved.
  Depend on zope.lifecycleevent in the right places.  This branch will
  not work without the movedaddedremoved branch of zope.lifecyclevent.

3.8.2 (unreleased)
------------------

- Partially break dependency on ``zope.traversing`` by disusing
  zope.traversing.api.getPath in favor of using
  ILocationInfo(object).getPath().  The rest of the runtime
  dependencies on zope.traversing are currently interface
  dependencies.

- Break runtime dependency on ``zope.app.dependable`` by using a zcml
  condition on the qsubscriber ZCML directive that registers the
  CheckDependency handler for IObjectRemovedEvent.  If
  ``zope.app.dependable`` is not installed, this subscriber will never
  be registered.  ``zope.app.dependable`` is now a testing dependency
  only.

3.8.1 (2009-04-03)
------------------

- Fixed misspackaged 3.8.0


3.8.0 (2009-04-03)
------------------

- Change configure.zcml to not depend on zope.app.component.
  Fixes: https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/348329

- Moved the declaration of ``IOrderedContainer.updateOrder``  to a new, basic
  ``IOrdered`` interface and let ``IOrderedContainer`` inherit it. This allows
  easier reuse of the declaration.

3.7.2 (2009-03-12)
------------------

- Fix: added missing ComponentLookupError, missing since revision 95429 and 
  missing in last release.

- Adapt to the move of IDefaultViewName from zope.component.interfaces
  to zope.publisher.interfaces.

- Add support for reserved names for containers. To specify reserved
  names for some container, you need to provide an adapter from the
  container to the ``zope.container.interfaces.IReservedNames`` interface.
  The default NameChooser is now also aware of reserved names.

3.7.1 (2009-02-05)
------------------

- Raise more "Pythonic" errors from ``__setitem__``, losing the dependency
  on ``zope.exceptions``:

  o ``zope.exceptions.DuplicationError`` -> ``KeyError``

  o ``zope.exceptions.UserError`` -> ``ValueError``

- Moved import of ``IBroken`` interface to use new ``zope.broken``
  package, which has no dependencies beyond ``zope.interface``.

- Made ``test`` part pull in the extra test requirements of this package.

- Split the ``z3c.recipe.compattest`` configuration out into a new file,
  ``compat.cfg``, to reduce the burden of doing standard unit tests.

- Stripped out bogus develop eggs from ``buildout.cfg``.

3.7.0 (2009-01-31)
------------------

- Split this package off ``zope.app.container``. This package is
  intended to have far less dependencies than ``zope.app.container``.

- This package also contains the container implementation that
  used to be in ``zope.app.folder``.
