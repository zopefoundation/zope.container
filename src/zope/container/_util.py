    Decorator. Given an object implemented in Python, with a name like
    ``Foo``, import the corresponding C implementation from
    ``persistent.c<NAME>`` with the name ``Foo`` and use it instead
    (where ``NAME`` is the module name).

    This can also be used for constants and other things that do not
    have a name by passing the name as the second argument.

    Example::

        @use_c_impl
        class Foo(object):
            ...

        GHOST = use_c_impl(12, 'GHOST')

    If the ``PURE_PYTHON`` environment variable is set to any value
    other than ``"0"``, or we're on PyPy, ignore the C implementation
    and return the Python version. If the C implementation cannot be
    imported, return the Python version. If ``PURE_PYTHON`` is set to
    0, *require* the C implementation (let the ImportError propagate);
    note that PyPy can import the C implementation in this case (and
    all tests pass).

    In all cases, the Python version is kept available in the module
    globals with the name ``FooPy``.

    If the Python version is a class that implements interfaces, then
    the C version will be declared to also implement those interfaces.

    If the Python version is a class, then each function defined
    directly in that class will be replaced with a new version using
    globals that still use the original name of the class for the
    Python implementation. This lets the function bodies refer to the
    class using the name the class is defined with, as it would
    expect. (Only regular functions and static methods are handled.)
    However, it also means that mutating the module globals later on
    will not be visible to the methods of the class. In this example,
    ``Foo().method()`` will always return 1::

        GLOBAL_OBJECT = 1
        @use_c_impl
        class Foo(object):
            def method(self):
                super(Foo, self).method()
